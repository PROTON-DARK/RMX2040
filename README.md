# TWRP tree for RMX2040
This tree was conventionally ready for the BPRP assembly parameters and a test of this Recovery was carried out and we stroked problems with mounting System_img sections and with the problem of encryption of the section mainly all the abundant working functions. You can try to assemble TWRP or OFRP, but I do not have time and experience for further work
